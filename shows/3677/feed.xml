      <description><![CDATA[<p>So, before setting any expectations based on the title of the episode, know this: Ten years later, our bodies respond to spaghetti-loading SUPER differently. </p><p>We all recorded this one together, and mostly spent it talking to our various family members, but also there are two impromptu musical numbers and a fierce competition of athletic prowess, so, yeah. Thank you all so much for sharing this past decade with us. You’ve changed our lives irrevocably, and there’s no way we’ll be able to repay that kindness in our lifetimes, so instead, we just ate a bunch of pasta and recorded it for you.</p>

      <itunes:summary>There&apos;s a lot more to the Home Alone series than slapstick home defense and Tim Curry&apos;s pronunciation of the word &quot;pizza.&quot; Like, a lot more. Some dark stuff, too -- and it all exists within the confines of Justin&apos;s pseudo-canonical thriller fiction.
Suggested talking points: Great British Fancast, Detergent Cop, Hugs for Drugs, Bye Bye Potter, Mrs. Bakula, Utility Ghost, Prequels</itunes:summary>

      <title>MBMBaM 142: Tom Bosley Upskirts</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>They said it couldn't be done! Who said it? We did. Because two-thirds of us were pretty sick all week, which makes recording a podcast (or sitting upright) a harrowing task. But we love you too much to quit. It's our biggest fault.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Suggested talking points: Throwing DJ Jazzy Jeff, Netflix with John Wayne Gacy, The Rest of the Story, A quiver of dildos, the shenannies, the documentary Jack Frost </p>

      <title>MBMBaM 115: Womenade</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello, oldest brother Justin McElroy here. I've taken over posting duties from Griffin this week, but I don't really know the things he normally writes. Does he just try to get you excited about it? Cause man, this episode ... it's got, you know, jokes. Jokes for miles. Oh man, the goof to not goof ratio, she's just dizzying.</p>
<p>Suggested talking points: Oh shit, what goes here? Like, the things we talked about? Umm, there was the thing about John Candy and the Jamaican Running Team, Griffin said "straight up Christmas crazy" and then we did the Womenade thing that I mentioned before and ... I don't know, it had lots of jokes.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's our second annual Candlenights special, and you know that means! Actually, you might not, since it's only the second time we've done it. Oh, well, it means that we go the whole episode without dropping any profane language, so you can share it with your innocent, nubile ears. Also, you shouldn't say "nubile ears" in front of them, because that's kind of profane.</p>

      <title>MBMBaM 51: Real Talk Live: Face 2 Face</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's MBMBaM's first live show ever -- and man, what a way to start our on-stage career! Not because we did a particularly good job, but because we very nearly talked about child pornography for a few minutes. We grabbed that bull right by the horns, and we stared at its eyes, and we said, "No, we probably shouldn't talk about child pornography. That's illegal."</p>
<p>Thanks to Jordan, Jesse Go for setting up such a special, intimate night, Dan Telfer for his special, intimate hosting, and every single person who came out to Second City for the show! You guys are, as ever, the cat's 'jamas.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
<p>On this week's episode, we take a short victory lap for the successes and triumphs of the Maximum Fun Drive. Actually, we don't take an actual lap, as we're all pretty out of shape, and that would make for some pretty bad radio. Just know that when we talk about Tyra Banks as a Street Fighter, we're doing so with victorious vim.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Between the lack of question submissions, the hurried pace and the general post-Holiday blues, we wouldn't exactly qualify this one as our "best episode."

<p>Suggested talking points: 95 and Not Alive, Jesus' hat-expanding magic, A wizard of comedy named Patch Adams, metaphorical smudgy sticks, discretion, Kevin James' reversible circumcision</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week's episode is dedicated to the neverending leadership and heroism exhibited every waking moment by Mr. Matthew McConnaughey. We suggest watching at least two of Mr. McConnaughey's motion pictures as a complimentary experience to this episode. Might we suggest Fools' Gold and Sahara? Or, if you're listening with a loved one, How To Lose a Guy In Ten Days and The Wedding Planner?</p>
<p>Suggested talking points: A constant bongo beat, wassassin, the Geordi contingent, big funeral home, Lolito, beer mall, deep cuts in the boneyard, the elegant curvature</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Look, there's one of two ways you can respond to our absence over Labor Day weekend: You can get angry, and demand an apology (which we'll happily give) -- but that's kind of a waste of time, isn't it? Let's go with option two, where we run, teary-eyed, into your arms, like prodigal sons returning to their loving fathers.</p>

      <itunes:summary>This week&apos;s episode is brought to you in stunning HIGH DEFINITION 360 DEGREE OMEGA-AUDIO, thanks to the acquisition of a new microphone for Travis, paid for by contributions from listeners like you. Assuming, of course, that you bought a T-Shirt or App. We feel the improved quality was the only missing ingredient keeping us from total podcast domination. Well, that and general laziness.
Suggested talking points: The mane event, a touch of slavery, stalker/stalkee, embraces, algebra follies, Bs before Hs, The Biggest Loser, a PSA</itunes:summary>

      <title>My Brother, My Brother and Me: Episode 09</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Though forces of nature attempted to tear us apart, the brothers  McElroy managed to carve 45 minutes out of our busy week to answer your  queries. Sure, it resulted in one of our more unconventional episodes,  but that's not to say it's "bad." Okay, the 22-minute freestyle verbal  jazz segment was weird and unnecessary, but we think it works pretty  well in context.</p>
<p>Suggested talking points: Uncle David's banjo, Mr. Stinky  Booty/True Survivor, body shapes, strip joint follies, Dakota Memorial  Mobile Spray Tanning Station, Swoopin' Osama, sexy clowns</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>After an unprecedented and, frankly, irresponsible one-week hiatus, we've returned to answer the deluge of questions the MBMBAM community flooded us with during the interlude. That just means we have a much sweeter stock of queries to choose from. Seriously, guys -- every single question in this episode is a matter of life or death. Especially  the one about teen make-out spots.  Suggested talking points: Golden Love Corral, Best Woman, Aaron (known dude), the circle of AIDS, long distance dating and shotputting, fat beers, Why Does The Sun Shine?, anger volcanoes, mama-law, friendship connections, On Kicking</p>

Which we'll dip into our economy-sized vat of Sweet Answer Dippin' Sauce, and instantly devour. Romantic troubles? Chomp. Workplace drama? Munch. Just found out you were born a woman, but were surgically rendered a man when you were two years old? Delicious.  Suggested talking points: Musical girlfriend, customer love, The Lake House, Flo-rida, Babystruck, Rebel Without a Cause, Beerbabies, D'Angelo, Deep remembrance, an MBMBAM proposal.</p>
